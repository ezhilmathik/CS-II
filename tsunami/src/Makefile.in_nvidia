# Makefile for finite element code TsunAWI

# Please adjust Fortran compiler and flags, path to netcdf
# to your specific computer

#===============================
# Fortran compiler and flags
#================================

# NVIDIA COMPILER (former PGI)
#-------------------
FC = nvfortran
## Options optimizing for speed (on the current cpu architecture)
FCFLAGS = -fast  -mp
## Options for debugging:
# FCFLAGS = -g -mp

AR = ar -r

#=================================
# Path to netcdf
#=================================

## If given by environment variables 
# NC_LIB   = $(NETCDF_LD)
# NC_INC  = -I$(NETCDF_INC)
## If in the standard path (e.g. /usr/lib), you may skip -L<path>
## We need the Fortran bindings, too, which can come as a seperate 
## lib (netcdff) or be in included in the main lib (netcdf).
# NC_LIB = -lnetcdf -lnetcdff
# NC_INC =
## A path at your system
NC_ROOT = /global/AWIsoft/netcdf/4.6.2_gnu
NC_LIB = -L$(NC_ROOT)/lib -Wl,-rpath,$(NC_ROOT)/lib -lnetcdf -lnetcdff
NC_INC = -I$(NC_ROOT)/include
## or no netcdf at all
# NC_LIB = -DNO_NETCDF
# NC_INC = 

#===============================
# Switch off "foxy" XML if not needed / desired
# Foxy source code comes with TsunAWI and is compiled by default.
# Switch off with:
FOXY_FLAG = -DNO_FOXY

#================================
# Choose single (real32) or double (real64) precision for
# floating point arithmetic.
# Single precision is the default, because it is sufficient
# for tsunami calculation, and faster.
# WP_FLAG = -DWORKING_PRECISION=real32

# Name of the executable

# Just choose whatever you like.
